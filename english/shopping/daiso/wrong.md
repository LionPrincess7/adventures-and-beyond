Oops! You're wrong! The answer isn't 1 or 7, of course. That would be too small!

You actually got 100 sheets of stickers（〇_ｏ）which is insane!! (i would do that too)        
＼(((￣(￣(￣▽￣)￣)￣)))／

The Daiso you went to was closing down in a few days, so you went there to check if there was any sales. The stickers were only 5¢ each! The designs were so cute that you couldn't resist buying them. Even if it was a 100.....dollars?!?!?!?? (lol jk you only spent $5 for a hundred sheets)

After checking out, what do you want to do now?

Go home and [do an unboxing video?](./unbox.md)

or...

Restart and [choose another adventure?](../choose-your-adventure.md)
