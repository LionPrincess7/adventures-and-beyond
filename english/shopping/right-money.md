You're right! You (suprisingly) only spent 15 dollars on a lot of stationery.                      
Practically flopping in your car, you decide to take a rest before driving.

19 minutes later...

You arrive home and suddenly you have the greatest idea!
You grab your bag of stationeries and dash off to your room.

30 minutes later...

Yay! You finally finished unboxing your haul composed of 20 pieces of stationery!                  
But... in your opinion (in real life), do you think $15 dollars is a good price for 20 pieces of stationery?

NOTE: the "pieces of stationery" doesn't mean individual pieces, like 1 pen. what i mean is like 5 pens in a plastic bag = "piece of stationery"
