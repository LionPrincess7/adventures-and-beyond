As quickly as you can, you try to find a ton of sticks in the shortest time possible.
"Here's one!" you think, "And here's three more!"

Flying like the wind, you finally find all the sticks you need.

"Hmmmm... Now how do i light the fire?"

Remembering what you were taught in camping school, you look around for some stones.

"Aha! I found some!" you exclaim.

You briskly rub them together near the sticks, and WHOOSH!

"A campfire! Yippee!!"

Now that you're done with making the fire, you wonder what you should do next.
Do you want to...

Go to [sleep](./go-sleep.md)?

or...

[Eat some food](./food.md)
