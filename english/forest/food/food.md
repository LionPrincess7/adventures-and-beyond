You scour in your bag for some food, and take it out. Before you take a bite, in the corner of your eye, you see multiple pairs of eyes looking at you.

"Ummm..." you think.

The eyes come forward, and as you look closer, you see that it's a raccoon and her kits!
They were hungry, and smelled the food you were about to eat. 

"Here you go," you say as you gently toss them your chicken sandwich.

Cautiously watching you, the raccoons grab the sandwich and run away!

"Oof," you think. "I'd better hurry up and eat my food because those raccoons are probably gonna come back!"

Quickly, you chomp on the last bite of your homemade pie slice and hurry to pack things up.

Not wanting raccoons to raid your bag, you decide to sleep in your car.
But before that, you also put out the fire.

Slightly putting down your car windows, you pull down the chair and go to sleep.
