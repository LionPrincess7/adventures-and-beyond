You dig through your bag for some marshmallows.
"Yes! I've found the marshmallows!" you exclaim, as you open the pack.

After that, you forgot to find a stick for your marshmallows.
Too lazy to stand up, you just find a decent, unburned stick from the fire.

"This will do," you think.

After you've roasted and eaten your marshmallows, you decide to go to sleep already.

You set out your sleeping bag and put out the fire.
