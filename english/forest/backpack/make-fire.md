You put the lighter in your pocket.

With your flashlight, you set off to find some sticks.
After a while, you've already found a whole armful of them!

Since you decided to cook some marshmallows, you then set a stick aside.
Getting the lighter from your pocket, you light the sticks up and start cooking your marshmallows.

After eating a delicious dinner, you set out your sleeping bag and put out the fire.
