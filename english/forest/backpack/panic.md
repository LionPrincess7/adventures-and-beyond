You panic as there is no lighter to be found! 
In your panic, you run around the little pile of sticks that you gathered.

To your dismay, you trip over your huge backpack, and fall face down on the dirt.
As you get up, to your suprise, the lighter is right beside your foot!

You literally have no words after what just happened.

You pick up the lighter and start a fire.
After you light it, the night finally blanketed the last light from the sun as the stars began to shine.

Now that you have time to do stuff, what's the first thing you do?

[Cook some marshmallows](./eat.md)?

or...

[Go to sleep](./sleep.md)?
