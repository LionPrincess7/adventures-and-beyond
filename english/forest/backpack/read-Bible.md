You take out the Bible and start reading it.
Looking around you, you think of everything that God has made.
Remembering a verse about that, you quickly flip to that page.

"It's Genesis 1:1!" you think.

"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." -[Genesis 1:1](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-1-1/)

After reading several verses, you decide to sleep in your sleeping bag now.
You set it out, and snuggle tight in it.
