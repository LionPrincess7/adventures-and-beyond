You watch as the sun goes down. As the skies darkened, you admire the sprinkled night sky full of stars.
Lost in your thoughts, you remember [Psalm 19:1](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Psalms-19-1/)

"The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork."

But then, a sudden howl snaps you back to reality.
"What was that?" you think.

What do you do???

Grab your things and [run away](./run.md) as fast as you can!!

[Turn on](./flashlight.md) your phone's flashlight

[Sit still](./sit-still.md)
