As you walk around with your flashlight, you pick up any stick or leaf you can find.
Knowing that you'll cook marshmallows, you set a stick aside for later.

Now that you've collected a heap of sticks and leaves, you set them all down in the middle of the cleared field.
Realizing that you don't have the lighter, you rummage in your bag like a raccoon to find it.

After a long while, you finally find it in the back pocket of the bag.

"Aha!" you exclaim.

You light the fire up, and, again, rummage in your bag to find the marshmallows.
You also pick up the stick that you saved earlier and start cooking the marshmallows.

Since you finished your sticky dinner, you decide to go to sleep.
You set out your sleeping bag and put out the fire.
