You're all set and ready to go!
You get in your car, and drive to the nearest forest you could find on Google Maps.
After a few minutes of driving, the silly thought of having a backpack inside a bag lingers around in your head. Then, suddenly, BEEEEP!! A person honks at you for almost crashing into them on the other side of the lane. "Whew," you think, "That was close."

You finally arrive at the woods and, suprisingly, you've already found the perfect camping spot!
Now that the sun begins to set, what do you do?

Do you...

[Build a fire?](./campfire.md)

[Unpack your bag](./unpack.md) and take a look at what's inside?

Just simply [sit there](./late.md) and enjoy the sunset?
