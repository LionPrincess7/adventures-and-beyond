You rummage in your bag, looking for the lighter.

Thinking that this was taking too long, you dump the backpack's contents all over the ground. Then the lighter finally falls out after countless shakes. "Aha!" you exclaim.

You pick up the lighter and start a fire. The sun has already set. 

"Just in time," you say, as you wonder what to do now.

Hmmm...should you:

[Cook some marshmallows](./eat.md)?

or...

[Go to sleep](./sleep.md)?
