You decide to camp in the forest tomorrow.
Your bag only fits two things, for some reason.

What do you bring in your small bag?

1. [A backpack full of things and your phone](forest/all-set-backpack.md) 
2. [Food and a camping bag](forest/all-set-food.md)
3. [Marshmallows! and a camping bag](forest/all-set-marshmallows.md)
